# Little Hacks: Teux Deux Tags & Night theme

> tiny piece of code to add coloured tags and custom night theme to Teux Deux

## Notes for myself

* `/.*/y`, sticky RegEx flag is ES6-only
* fix following:
	* present-dat / done is too bright
	* user > dropdown - black on white, on hover black on black
	* headers should be aligned left (tags visually require this)
	* future: lower brightness (as lists, maybe even less)
	* footer border-top: darken.
